# Speech-command-classification
This project aims to implement a voice assistant to recognize and classify the command into one of the 12 classes. These titles incude the following: bonds (اوراق), currency (ارز), coin (سکه), bank (بانک), gold (طلا), petroleum (نفت), derivatives (مشتقات), metals (فلزات), stock fund (صندوق سهامی), fixed income fund (صندوق درامد ثایت), mixed fund (صندوق مختلط), tradable fund (صندوق قابل معامله). The commands are recorded and trained in Persian. To do so, we implemented a custom convolutional neural network in Python and trained it to get a high accuracy of 85%.
